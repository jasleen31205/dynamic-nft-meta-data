# dynamic-nft-meta-data
Dynamic NFT Metadata is a project that enables the creation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with attributes that can change over time. This functionality allows NFT holders to experience a more interactive and engaging ownership experience, as the metadata can be updated based on real-time events or conditions.
